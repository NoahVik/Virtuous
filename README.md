...........Kind Mind...........
```
Hard to forget her face is of that kind
Divine work of divine mind
``` 
```
Her expressions diverse and one of kind
In a second they hold ones mind
```
```
100 of spins, hours pass Time cease for my mind
Held by her eyes rhymes and smiles in trance of a kind
```
```
Hard to unlock her beliefs her mind
Close to her heart they of kind
```
```
Few wrong words And she do mind...
And then not intersted she in chat of any Kind
Acting Like a royality of kind
What is it? It escapes my mind
```
```
Had to work hard to lighten her mind
Her every words reflect her wise mind
In just few words she Illuminates my mind
Is there another of your kind
```
