...........Kind Mind...........
```
Hard to forget her face is of that kind
Divine work of divine mind
``` 
```
Her expressions diverse and one of kind
In a second they hold ones mind
```
```
100 of spins, hours pass Time cease for my mind
Held by her eyes rhymes and smiles in trance of a kind
```
```
Hard to unlock her beliefs her mind
Close to her heart they of kind
Anxious she gets Like iam of serial killer Kind
```
```
Few wrong words And she do mind...
And then not intersted she in chat of any Kind
```
```
Acting like royality of kind
What is it? It still escapes my mind
```
```
Takes explanations and while to lighten her mind
Her replies reflect her wise mind
And when i listen answers I do find
In her few words she Illuminates my mind
```
```
Is there any other of your kind
Pure of heart without greed of any Kind
Hard to forget someone really this kind
```
```
Wind up was my mind Without a way to Find
Just her few words and i see it was illusion of a Kind
```

```
